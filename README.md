# CutAndAdd

This is a tool that can create a cutout and support structure for a component in the supporting part.

For example: you can place a fan for an electrical product and the tool can create a hole and the necesary supports on the plastic part.

Here's a movie to explain the idea: http://autode.sk/1SbuAPE
